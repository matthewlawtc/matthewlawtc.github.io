  <h2> My Aims in ITB </h2>
  <p> From this course, I aim to have a great understanding in Information Technology.  I hope that I can gain a solid knowledge in programming development, 
design, development and implementation. I hope to learn the skills such as development websites, building databases, using client server technologies, and cloud computing.  
I hope to apply these technologies in business.  So skills such as program applications and website creation ana maintenance, debugging and troubleshooting would ber useful. </p>

  <h2> Things I learnt </h2>
  <p> Use Python to create a data menu system for users to generate report and use graph to analyse the data. </p>
  <p> Use Google Sites and Github to create a website </p>
  <p> Use Python to process XML data into a list of dictionary and print data in JSON. </p>
  <p> Programming activities involve programming design, programming development, unit data testing and documentation. </p>
  <p> Programming design includes object oriented design of data structure. </p>
  <p> Program development involve reading input data, validate input data and data error handling. </p>
  <p> Create website requiring authentication. </p>
  
  <h2> Challenges </h2>
  <p> The formatting of error data. </p>
  <p> Testing of data structure if the data is a float number. </p>
  <p> Exception handling in catching errors to the top level. </p>
